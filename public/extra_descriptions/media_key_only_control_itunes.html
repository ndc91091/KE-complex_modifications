  Description
</p>
<p>
  From Mac OS High Sierra, Apple added new feature that media keys can control not only iTunes,
  but also safari, chrome (youtube, facebook video), spotify, or other media players. <br />
  This would be annoying feature to someone who wanted to media keys only works for iTunes player, as before.
  If you want to make media key (F7,F8,F9) only control iTunes, enable this option.
