  Personal Rules by
  <a href="https://github.com/rakeshtembhurne">@rakeshtembhurne</a>. Disables
  auto jumping keys which are typed-in automatically anytime causing unwanted
  typed characters or behavior.
</p>
<p>
  For me key `left_option` started turning on anytime, causing weird symbols to
  appear while writing. Also it is in pressed down state always, causing every
  other key to behave differently. Sometimes I could not even log in as correct
  password is not being typed. Similar things happened with number 9 key. It
  started auto typing automatically.
</p>
<p>
  This configuration is settings for disabling 'left_option' key and '9' key
  (which is also a '(' when used with shift key). With these configs applied,
  normal behavior of key 9 will be disabled and they will only work when they
  are pressed with 'fn' button.
</p>
<p>
  So, fn + 9 will be 9, and fn + shift + 9 will be '('. Disabled keys will be
  left_option, 9 and shift + 9 which is '('.
</p>
