</p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold">
  Version 1.1 : Now support Microsoft Remote Desktop 10
</p>
<p>Schedule features:</p>
	<ul>
	 	<li>We do not have yet tools to distinguish the remote session window from those which sometimes open asking for credentials before the remote connexion is set. Beware of passwords that use symbols that are not common to the PC and Mac keyboard.</li>
	 	<li>You can not use the option "Use F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys" in a specific application yet. But as we regularly need F5 to "update" on Windows, my advice is to activate this option permanently. I'm afraid there will never be any change on this point.</li>
	 	<li>Some configurations require the use of unexpected keys: <a href="https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/1172">Current key to use for complex editing on Mac French keyboard # 1172</a> .</li>
	</ul>
<p>Known troubles:</p>
	<ul>
	 	<li>When the virtual keyboard is opened in your remote Windows session, some keys may behave strangely (for example, a grave accent).</li>
	 	<li>MacBook users with Touch Bar may need to add these rules: <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/help/troubleshooting/touch-bar-function-keys/">Touch bar does not change to f1-f12 when I press the key fn</a>.</li>
